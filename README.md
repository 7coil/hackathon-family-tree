# hackathon-family-tree
Tracking the lineage of the EU hackathon scene! 

If you think you know where a hackathon lives in this tree, or you see an error, please create a pull request. 

Whilst we go through data discovery, this will initially be an awful list of lists. There may be repeated data as nested lists don't express multiple-parents very well.
